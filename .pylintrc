[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once). You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use "--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W".
disable=invalid-name,
        missing-docstring,
        redefined-builtin,
        abstract-method

expected-line-ending-format=LF

# String used as indentation unit. This is usually "    " (4 spaces) or "\t" (1
# tab).
indent-string='    '

# Maximum number of characters on a single line.
max-line-length=120


[BASIC]

           j,

           ex,
           Run,
